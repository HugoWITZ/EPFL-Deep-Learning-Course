## Overview

The repository is structured into different mini-projects, each focusing on a specific aspect of deep learning. The projects are implemented in PyTorch and provide hands-on experience with deep learning models, training, and evaluation.

### Mini-Project 1

- **Model Implementation**: The core of the first project is a deep learning model implemented in PyTorch. The model, defined in [model.py](https://github.com/HugoWITZ/EPFL-Deep-Learning-Course/blob/master/Miniproject_1/model.py), includes multiple convolutional layers and employs techniques like ReLU activation and max pooling.
- **Training and Testing**: The training process is detailed in the same file, with a focus on optimizing the model parameters. The [test.py](https://github.com/HugoWITZ/EPFL-Deep-Learning-Course/blob/master/Miniproject_1/test.py) script is used for evaluating the model.
- **Utilities**: Additional helper functions and classes, such as `NoisyDataset` and `psnr` for performance evaluation, are provided in [helpers.py](https://github.com/HugoWITZ/EPFL-Deep-Learning-Course/blob/master/Miniproject_1/others/helpers.py).
- **Visualization**: For visualizing the results, [visualization.py](https://github.com/HugoWITZ/EPFL-Deep-Learning-Course/blob/master/Miniproject_1/others/visualization.py) includes necessary functions.
- **Report**: A detailed explanation of the project and its outcomes can be found in [Report_1.pdf](https://github.com/HugoWITZ/EPFL-Deep-Learning-Course/blob/master/Miniproject_1/Report_1.pdf).

### Mini-Project 2

- **Model and Training**: Similar to Mini-Project 1, this project includes model implementation and training scripts. The model is defined in [model.py](https://github.com/HugoWITZ/EPFL-Deep-Learning-Course/blob/master/Miniproject_2/model.py).
- **Utilities and Modules**: Additional helper functions and custom modules are provided in the `others` directory.
- **Report**: The project's findings and methodology are documented in [Report_2.pdf](https://github.com/HugoWITZ/EPFL-Deep-Learning-Course/blob/master/Miniproject_2/Report_2.pdf).
